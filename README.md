# Calculator_CLI
command-line calculator App

The script is structured for readability and modularity. Each arithmetic operation is implemented as a separate function.
add(x, y) – Returns the sum of two numbers
subtract(x, y) – Returns the difference
multiply(x, y) – Returns the product
divide(x, y) – Handles division and checks for divide-by-zero
The main() function runs a loop that displays a menu and takes user input for operation and numbers then calls the appropriate function and displays the result.
It also includes error handling for invalid input using try-except and input validation for numbers and menu selection.
